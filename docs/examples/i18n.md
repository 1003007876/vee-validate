# Internationalization

These are a couple of examples to localize vee-validate messages.

## `localize` API

This example uses the `localize` function, this is usually a good solution for those who use non-nodejs solutions for SSR, the localization will be handled on the client side as a result.

TODO: Example with simple form with localization switching.

## vue-i18n

This example integrates [vue-i18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) with vee-validate.

TODO: Example with a simple form with localization switching.

## Custom Implementation

In the Same way as the previous example with `vue-i18n`, you can use any implementation for i18n with vee-validate, this example uses a popular minimal package called [LingUI](https://lingui.js.org/)

TODO: Use langUI package to build an example.
